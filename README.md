# API
There ain't much to the API. There are 2 functions:
- giveFood(Player, Food (as string), Amount) --> Gives a player food
- getFoods() --> returns a list of all valid food names

There are also 2 events:
- TonicFoodEatEvent --> Fired when a player eats the food and right before the effects take place (can cancel)
- TonicFoodGiveEvent --> Fired whenever a player obtains food from TonicFoods (can cancel + get string of the food)

The API isn't perfect, but it's honest work.
